  "name": "Barbell Front Squat",
  "description": "The barbell front squat is a compound movement that emphasizes building the lower-body muscle groups. With the barbell racked in front of the body on the anterior delts, the front squat emphasizes the quads and glutes, but also upper back and core strength to remain upright. Front squats can be trained as an alternative to back squats, as an accessory movement for either squats or deadlifts, or for strength and muscle on their own. Many lifters and athletes prefer them to back squats, although they can be uncomfortable and difficult to learn at first.",
